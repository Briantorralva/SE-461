# Snake Game Testing Project

# Overview
This repository contains a simple Snake game program that was used as a learning project to understand and implement unit testing using JUnit and measure test coverage with JaCoCo in Eclipse.

# Objectives
* Understand and implement JUnit test cases.
* Achieve high test coverage using JaCoCo.
* Learn to access and test private methods using reflection without modifying the source code.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Eclipse IDE
* JUnit 4 or higher
* JaCoCo plugin for Eclipse

# Key Learnings
* JUnit: We learned to write efficient unit tests to validate our code.
* JaCoCo: We utilized this tool to measure and improve our test coverage.
* Reflection: We learned to access and test private methods without changing the source code to public.

# Conclusion
This project helped us understand the importance of unit testing and test coverage in software development. By achieving high coverage and writing comprehensive test cases, we ensured the robustness and reliability of our code.
